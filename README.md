# Tables
working with xlsx files from PyCharm

In Tables.py there is a code which imports openpyxl directory in order to process the file Population_in_millions.xlsx.
In Population_in_millions.xlsx there is the table which contains number of people (in millions) of particular religion on all continents.
Program takes that file and converts numbers of people in millions to percentages.
At the end, program saves that percentages to the new file titled Population_per_percentage.xlsx.
